Introduction

Climate change is one of the most important environmental problems we face today, affecting not only humans but also other species of the planet. It takes more than soil, water, and sunshine to make the world green. At least 30% of the world’s crops and 90% of all plants require cross-pollination to spread and thrive. As pollinators, bees play a part in every aspect of the ecosystem. Bees contribute to complex, interconnected ecosystems that allow a diverse number of different species to coexist. However, the bee population is in a rapid decline across the globe, stressed by pesticides, lack of food, and pollution. In our exploratory data analysis, we will focus on the effects of pollution on bees in the US and American honey agriculture.


Objective/Hypothesis:

The goal of this project is to explore the increase in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the effect it has on honey production over the years (1998-2019) in the United States.


Key questions to be answered:

(1) Over time, what sources produce the most pollution in the US from 1998-2019?  

(2) How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2019?

(3) Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and total pollution?

(4) How has each sector affected honey production? 

(5) Is there a correlation between bee colonies and honey production?



Analysis:
 
(1) As CO2 is an important GreenHouse Gas, we looked at it’s emissions.
    We looked at the major contributors of CO2 emissions. Production of electric power, transportation and Industrial emissions are the main polluters
    The next graph is the CO2 levels from 1998 to 2019. During the years 2005, 2006, the CO2 emissions were maximum. It was surprising to find that the CO2 level in       the atmosphere is decreasing over the years.(Slide 7 in the Google slides in the above link)
    The next 3 sets of graphs show the relationship between CO2 levels and the major polluters. (Slide 8 through 10 in the Google slides in the above link)
    When we look at the transportation sector, there is not much correlation between CO2 and Transport emissions. As the r squared value is very low (0.29).  Our           conclusion was that the GreenHouse Gas emissions produced by Transport are increasing but they are not CO2. (Slide 8)
    In the Electric Power Production area, the Electric Power Production directly impacts  the CO2 levels. The r squared value is about 0.8 Here there’s a definite
    correlation between the production of electric power and CO2.(Slide 9)
    The plot of Industrial Emissions follows the CO2. The r squared value is 0.55. So the correlation is strong.(Slide 10)
  


Final Conclusions:
