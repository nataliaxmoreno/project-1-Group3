Introduction

Climate change is one of the most important environmental problems we face today, affecting not only humans but also other species of the planet. It takes more than soil, water, and sunshine to make the world green. At least 30% of the worldâ€™s crops and 90% of all plants require cross-pollination to spread and thrive. As pollinators, bees play a part in every aspect of the ecosystem. Bees contribute to complex, interconnected ecosystems that allow a diverse number of different species to coexist. However, the bee population is in a rapid decline across the globe, stressed by pesticides, lack of food, and pollution. In our exploratory data analysis, we will focus on the effects of pollution on bees in the US and American honey agriculture.

Objective/Hypothesis:

The goal of this project is to explore the increase in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the effect it has on honey production over the years (1998-2019) in the United States.

Key questions to be answered:

(1) Over time, what sources produce the most pollution in the US from 1998-2019?  
(2) How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2019?
(3) Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and total pollution?
(4) How has each sector affected honey production? 
(5) Is there a correlation between bee colonies and honey production?



Final Conclusions:
