Introduction

Climate change is one of the most important environmental problems we face today, affecting not only humans but also other species of the planet. It takes more than soil, water, and sunshine to make the world green. At least 30% of the world’s crops and 90% of all plants require cross-pollination to spread and thrive. As pollinators, bees play a part in every aspect of the ecosystem. Bees contribute to complex, interconnected ecosystems that allow a diverse number of different species to coexist. However, the bee population is in a rapid decline across the globe, stressed by pesticides, lack of food, and pollution. In our exploratory data analysis, we will focus on the effects of pollution on bees in the US and American honey agriculture.


Objective/Hypothesis:

The goal of this project is to explore the increase in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the effect it has on honey production over the years (1998-2019) in the United States.


Key questions to be answered:

(1) Over time, what sources produce the most pollution in the US from 1998-2019?  

(2) How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2019?

(3) Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and total pollution?

(4) How has each sector affected honey production? 

(5) Is there a correlation between bee colonies and honey production?



Analysis:
 
(1) As CO2 is an important GreenHouse Gas, we looked at it’s emissions.
    We looked at the major contributors of CO2 emissions. Production of electric power, transportation and Industrial emissions are the main polluters
    The next graph is the CO2 levels from 1998 to 2019. During the years 2005, 2006, the CO2 emissions were maximum. It was surprising to find that the CO2 level in       the atmosphere is decreasing over the years.(Slide 7 in the Google slides in the above link)
    The next 3 sets of graphs show the relationship between CO2 levels and the major polluters. (Slide 8 through 10 in the Google slides in the above link)
    When we look at the transportation sector, there is not much correlation between CO2 and Transport emissions. As the r squared value is very low (0.29).  Our           conclusion was that the GreenHouse Gas emissions produced by Transport are increasing but they are not CO2. (Slide 8)
    In the Electric Power Production area, the Electric Power Production directly impacts  the CO2 levels. The r squared value is about 0.8 Here there’s a definite
    correlation between the production of electric power and CO2.(Slide 9)
    The plot of Industrial Emissions follows the CO2. The r squared value is 0.55. So the correlation is strong.(Slide 10)


(2) The data shows that the honey production is spread over 44 states from 1998-2019 

We saw that the top producing states were North Dakota, California, South Dakota, Florida, Montana, Minnesota, and Texas. It was surprising to see   colder states ND, SD, and MN producing the top amounts of honey. We assumed that bees thrive in warmer areas like CA, FL, and TX.

The overall honey production in the US has been decreasing over the years with ppikes in 2008, 2010, 2014.

Honey production is measured by number of colonies and yield per colony. Total honey production = number of colonies * average yield per colony.    
  
  
(3) As we look into the honey production data, the number of bee colonies of the US from 1998 to 2019, and we compare those datasets with the CO2 emission data, we found that as the CO2 emission increases, the number of colonies decrease. The total honey production increases as the CO2 emission increases, there is no correlation between CO2 emission and the total honey production.
    
    
(4) According to the linear regression and r-value of 0.2022, there is a positive correlation amongst honey production and the emissions from transportation (our largest polluter), however it is a somewhat weak correlation as it has an r-value of 0.2 although weak, both honey production and transportation emissions increase.  
There is also a positive correlation amongst honey production and electric power industry emissions, with an r-value of 0.383.  Those two variables have a weak correlation, although it is a stronger correlation in comparison to the honey production and transportation emission correlation.  
when we look at honey production and the emissions from agriculture.  After performing a regression analysis we obtained an r-value of -0.53. it showed a negative correlation, and since it has an r-value of above 0.4 we can say there is a moderate correlation. 
   

(5) from 1998 to 2008 the number of colonies decreased considerably, reaching the lowest point of about 2.3 million colonies in the entire country in 2008. From 2009 to 2010,  the population of bee colonies recovered, surpassing 2.6 million. Despite the fact that the number of colonies have not decreased as much as they did during the first 10 year period of the study, we can see that the population is still stuck in the 2.6 to 2.8 million range over the last 5 years. 
Even though it seems promising that the bee colonies are somehow surviving and overall increasing in number, that is not the whole story, there is a drastic decrease in the amount of honey the colonies are able to produce over the 20 years of data gathered.Bee colonies from the 1998 harvest were able to produce around 3000 pounds of honey. By 2019 the colonies could barely produce 2000 pounds even with having more colonies than ever recorded in the data. It is also interesting to see how in 2008 to 2009 the yield per colony decreased dramatically while in that same year bee colonies were increasing in number. This is because honey is not harvested  during the first year of the beehive because the colony is still growing and working on its honey production.
The correlation between honey production and number of colonies over the years where we obtained an r-value 0.145. It is fair to say that there is  a non-existent correlation between those two variables. To summarize, the total amount of honey produced by colonies is not necessarily impacted by how many colonies there are.

Final Conclusions:
Honey production vs net emissions with an R-value = 0.45, Seems to have a moderate correlation overall! According to the data analysis we cannot clearly state whether or not the amount of emissions emitted annually have an impact on the production of honey. We would need to look at other variables to make further predictions.  Some of the things we could look into are, which regions produce the most honey, and how are those regions affected by climate change; are those regions experiencing more dramatic climate change weather patterns, or how are the honey bee farms working to solve the saddening decline in the honey bee population.  There can be many factors contributing to the overall decrease in honey production, namely, the reduction in bee colonies.  However, that begs the question, why are honey bee colonies decreasing. We would need to dig deeper and find more data relating to bees in order to find a correlation.  

The data tells us that honey production has been declining in the past 2 decades; although emissions have also been on a slight decline, with a range of 451.4 million metric tons…the overall decrease is rather insignificant at 7.3%. Honey Production range = 64,015,000; percent decrease = 29.2% The honey production decrease is close to 30%, which is alarming. 

Bee colonies vs net emissions - r-value = - 0.613 This is the strongest correlation we have found in our data analysis The number of bee colonies has, to our surprise, risen in the past 2 decades by 6.14%. Although that is not a significant increase, it was surprising considering the total honey production has decreased by close to 30%. 

There is a positive correlation between honey production and net emissions indicating both variables are moving in the same direction…in this case they are both moving downwards. The r-value is 0.45 indicating there is a moderate positive correlation.  When we look a little further, we calculated that the honey production decrease was 29.2% and the emissions decrease was about 7.3%.  The fact that the honey production decrease is close to 30% is very alarming.
 There is a negative correlation between the number of bee colonies and emissions, with an r-value of -0.585.  This indicates that as the number of bee colonies were on the rise, the emissions were on a decrease.  To our surprise, the number of bee colonies has increased, although the percent increase is not significant at 6.14%.  So, as we saw an approximate increase of 6% in bee colonies, we saw a rather significant decrease of 30% in honey.
